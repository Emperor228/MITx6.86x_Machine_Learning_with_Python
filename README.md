# MITx6.86x_Machine_Learning_with_Python
This repository contains four machine learning projects I have done at the course Machine Learning with Python. Cooperated with the course team.
I have uploaded the code before and after me. You can click on the history to highlight the work I have done.


 

  1.Automatic Review Analyzer : 
  
       Where I implemented classifiers on a given food review dataset written by Amazon customers for various food products with labels representing a positive or negative review.
       Implemented and compared three types of linear classifiers: the perceptron, the average perceptron, and the Pegasos.
       With the bag of words representation and feature engineering, achieved 80.8% accuracy on the test data set
       
  2.Digit recognition : 
  
       Built a deep convolution neural network to recognize digits on the MNIST and the multi-digit version of MNIST database .
       Achieved 99% accuracy on the test set of the single-digit MNIST with an 8-layer convolution neural network.
       Other approaches such as support vector machine, multinomial regression, Gaussian RBF kernels were also implemented and compared.
       
  3.Collaborative Filtering via Gaussian Mixtures : 
  
       Built a Gaussian mixture model for collaborative filtering on a given data matrix containing movie ratings made by users from a Netflix database.
       Implemented the EM algorithm for matrix completion.
       
  4.Text-Based Game : 
  
       Built a deep reinforcement learning model on a given simple text-based games.
